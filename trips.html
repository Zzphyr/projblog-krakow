        <h2 class="tp-subtitle">Day 1</h2>
        <h3 class="local-name">Main Market Square <em>(Rynek Główny)</em></h3>
        <p>As soon as we arrived in Krakow, we headed to Old Town to visit Main Market Square, the city’s huge central square. Forever a hive of activity at any hour of the day, this over 3700 square meters open space (said to be the largest in Europe!) is composed by a myriad of café’s, museums, pubs, souvenir shops, historical landmarks and all things beautiful architecture.</p>

        <h3 class="local-name">Cloth Hall <em>(Sukiennice)</em></h3>
        <p>The main building right at the center of the square is the Cloth Hall, where international trade was concentrated. Considered the world's oldest shopping mall, this pearl of Renaissance architecture dates from 1555 and features in its interior many food stalls and small shops, terrace cafes and flower stands that surround the statue of Adam Mickiewicz. If you are in a rush to buy souvenirs, Cloth Hall have your worries covered all in one place.</p>

        <h3 class="local-name">St. Mary’s Basilica (Kościół Mariacki)</h3>
        <p>On a corner of the square is St. Mary’s Basilica, one of the most famous of Poland's many churches. This Gothic structure features two striking towers of different heights and is surprisingly richly decorated inside, thanks to the vibrant polychromy by polish artist Jan Matejko. In the midst of all this wonder, the central masterpiece is without a doubt the breathtaking main altar, by Veit Stoss, illustrating the life of St. Mary and Jesus.</p>

        <h3 class="local-name">Rynek Underground (Podziemia Rynku Głównego w Krakowie)</h3>
        <p>Under the surface of the market square we visited this hi-tech and highly popular museum, which took us four metres below ground and many years into the past, to explore excavated medieval merchant stalls complete with objects, coins, decorations of old, and to experience the contemporary multimedia exhibits that showcase the city’s entire history up until this day. We recommend coming here on your first day to get a good idea of Kraków’s historic hidden gems when wandering the streets. </p>

        <h3 class="local-name">Wawel Royal Castle <em>(Zamek Królewski na Wawelu)</em></h3>
        <p>On day 2 we ventured to Wawel Castle. One of the most famous castles in Poland, it’s located on a hill high above the city, and its beautifully restored buildings are a delight to behold. We enjoyed historic architecture from different eras, royal rooms filled with artworks and curious items, a magnificent cathedral and an armory with old treasures (makes you wonder just how many kinds of helmets there are). It even has a dragon’s cave. A fire breathing metal dragon!</p>

        <h3 class="local-name">Jewish District <em>(Kazmierz)</em></h3>
        <p>Continuing our visits through Polish rich history, we walked over to Kazmierz, the center for Jewish life for half a millennia before being destroyed in WW2. Despite its sad story, this now bohemian district has become a major tourist place and a pilgrimage site for Jews, which led to the return of contemporary Jewish culture in the area. Want fashionable little shops? Kazmierz has it. Chic drinks? Kazmierz has it. A cheap and tasty <em>zapiekanka</em>, a polish open-faced sandwich? Just go to the central square!</p>

        <h3 class="local-name">Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory <em>(Fabryka Emalia Oskara Schindlera)</em></h3>
        <p>Still confronting Krakow’s grim history, we visited the Oskar Schindler Enamel Factory. From the outside it looks just like an everyday factory, but as soon as we walked in, it transformed into a great museum experience. It is now an exhibition that tells the story about Kraków and its inhabitants during WW2, the Nazis, the Soviets, and also about Oskar Schindler and how he saved thousands of Jews under his employment.</p>

        <h2 class="tp-subtitle">Day 3</h2>
        <h3 class="local-name">Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial and museum</h3>
        <p>The apotheosis of our WW2 revival was visiting the Auschwitz Concentration Camp (Konzentrationslager Auschwitz) and the nearby camp fron the same complex, Birkenau. It was a complex built by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland and is the symbol of the Holocaust. Fences were everywhere, and inside the barracks there is a memorial with items that were stolen from the victims. We also got to see the gas chambers and ovens. Nowadays, the serenity betrays the horrific events witnessed by it walls. A lady in our group started crying. Everything is preserved as a way of making sure history is remembered in order not to be repeated. Never forget!

        <h3 class="local-name">Wieliczka Salt Mine <em>(Kopalnia soli Wieliczka)</em></h3>
        <p>Outside ofKrakow, but worth the visit, is the Wieliczka Salt Mine. This mine is explored since the Neolithic times and operated commercially until recently, now being transformed into a museum. Its attractions include the shafts and labyrinthine passageways, displays of historic salt-mining technology, an underground brine water lake, four underground chapels (they told us people can totally get married there!) and numerous statues carved by miners out of the rock salt, and even recent sculptures by contemporary artists. Oh, and visitors are welcome to lick the walls. It tasted, well, salty.</p>
